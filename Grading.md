# Grading and project

Grading is based on a project alone. The grading scheme is as follows:

```
<51; 60) % 3
<61; 70) % 3.5
<71; 80) % 4
<81; 90) % 4.5
>= 91% 5
```

## Project 

The project is done in pairs. Please choose someone with a similar ML/DL experience. This is gonna help both of you take the most from this project. For the project you need to choose one of the following datasets: 

1. [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
- This is a 'Hello World' dataset for ML, if you've never worked with Deep Learning, this is probably the best choice for you. 
- This dataset contains of gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine
- Size of each picture is 28x28, in total 784 pixels.
- **Goal**: Train a DL model to recognize hand drawn digits (Classification)

2. [Fashion MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)
- If you know the basic MNIST, worked a lot with it (or at least enough to be done with it) this is a spiced up version dealing with fashion
- Dataset of Zalando's article images, gray-scale pictures, belonging to 10 classes
- Picture dimentions 28x28, in total 784 pixels
- **Goal**: Train a DL model to recognize articles of clothing (Classification)

3. [Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arnab132/weather-dataset)
- If you worked with DL before and want something more challangening this is the dataset for you
- This dataset needs way more planning, conseptualising and data architecture and preparation.
- This is a tabular dataset consisnting of distinct measurements of weather conditions with summaries written in plain text.
- **Goal**: Train a DL model to predict temperature for the next day, based on three day window. Model gets data from last three days - outputs the predited temperature for the next day. As you can guess, uou cannot use apparent_temperature column anywhere in your predictions (Regression)
